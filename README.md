# Angular E-Commerce App

Google Firebase Realtime Database is
used in this application.
Since I'm using it in the trial version,
it is necessary to change the Database URL after a while.
You can change apiUrl from environment.ts file.


Bootstrap, SweetAlert and Font Awesome were used as third parties.
